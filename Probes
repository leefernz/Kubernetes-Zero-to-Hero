In Kubernetes, probes are used to check the health and status of containers to ensure applications are running properly. There are three main types — Startup, Liveness, and Readiness probes — each serving a specific purpose:

🔹 1. Startup Probe

Purpose: Used to check if the application inside the container has started successfully.

When it’s used: For applications that take a long time to start (like those with heavy initialization).

Behavior:

Until the startup probe succeeds, Kubernetes will not run liveness or readiness probes.

Prevents the container from being killed prematurely by the liveness probe.

Example:

startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10


→ This gives the container up to 5 minutes (30×10s) to start before being considered failed.

🔹 2. Liveness Probe

Purpose: Checks if the container is still running and healthy.

When it’s used: During the container’s lifecycle, after it has started.

Behavior:

If the probe fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.

Ensures self-healing of pods.

Example:

livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 20


→ Checks every 20s if the app is still alive. If it fails, the pod is restarted.

🔹 3. Readiness Probe

Purpose: Checks if the application is ready to serve traffic.

When it’s used: After the container starts — determines if it should receive requests.

Behavior:

If the probe fails, Kubernetes removes the pod from the Service endpoints (stops sending traffic).

Unlike liveness, it doesn’t restart the container.

Example:

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10


→ Ensures traffic only goes to healthy pods.
