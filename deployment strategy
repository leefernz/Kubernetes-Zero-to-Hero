rollout - kubernetes default deployment strategy. near zero downtime. 
  ex - when we set replicaset as 4 and do a rollout with v2.. it will first try to replace the first pod with v2 and if everything is ok. it will replace other pods as well. In order to
  work this ra=eadiness probe needs to be set.

  Canary - Powerfull deployment strategy it lets you test it on prod env. there are 2 deployments with one as V1 deployment and other one as V2(cananry). when new version is released 
  we set the percentage of traffic that should go to V2. To implement this there is a ingress annotataion with traffic weightage we set it to lets say 10 percent. then 10 per of traffic is 
  sent to v2 and once the testing is finished more weightage is provided.

  Bluegreen - Most Safest and costly deployment strategy. We will have 2 ENVs for this blue and green with load balancer placed on top. Blue env is the current version and green will the
  new version that we want to deploy
